#### _Introduction_

In my effort to learn computer vision with OpenCV and Python I always incur in some common tasks I need to accomplish before diving into the real juice of each project. Image preprocessing is always needed when working with images. Most of the times this ecompass different actions:

* changing image format
* resizing
* thresholding
* edging
* contour detection
* many more

I use to write a function each time I end up doing a copy+paste of a snippet more than 2/3 times. I am italian, I don't want to spend time copy pasting code. It's a waste of time I can spend to take a good coffee. But I am also a physicist with some efficiency obsessions. I'm scared to death one day I will write a so messy and inefficient code that the world will crash. Or worse, I would have to pass entire days modifying all the code I wrote. I try to keep it clean, commented, compact and modular.

So I put every utility function I use in my Computer Vision projects in ```imwizard```, my own version of OpenCV Python toolbox. And sincerely, I use it a lot! I have a passion for graphics too, so I always make some logos or banners for my READMEs...don't take it too seriously! it's just a creative caprice.
